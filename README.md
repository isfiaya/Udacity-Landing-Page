# Udacity Landing-Page-Project

Landing Page project for udacity nano-degree

[My web page hosted online on GitHub Pages](https://isfiaya.github.io/Udacity-Landing-Page/)

## Purpose

This landing page was build in order to accomplish the module 2 of the frontend developer Nanodegree

## What I did!

### Scroll to Anchor

- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

### Section Active Stat

- Define which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

### Navigation

- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.
